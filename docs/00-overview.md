# Overview

## Goal
Build a cloud-style observability platform for my homelab that provides:
- uptime and availability monitoring
- metrics and performance dashboards
- log aggregation and searching
- operational visibility for Proxmox + VMs + services

## Why this matters
This project demonstrates real infrastructure skills:
- production-style monitoring patterns
- containerized deployments using Docker Compose
- debugging/operations mindset
- security-first homelab design (no unnecessary exposure)
